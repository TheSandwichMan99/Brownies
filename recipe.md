Step 1: Get two medium/large sized bowls. One will be for all of the wet ingredients, and one will be for all of the dry ingredients.

Step 2: Crack your eggs into one of the bowls. Mix the eggs while putting in vanilla extract and optional coffee.

Step 3: Add the granulated sugar and the brown sugar into the mixture. Whisk until it becomes a smooth paste.

Step 4: Sift in the flour, salt, and cocoa powder. Mix until smooth again.

Step 5: Pour all of the chocolate chips in and mix. If you don't have chocolate chips or choose not to put them in, you can skip this step.

Step 6: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit.

Step 7: Get your 8x8-inch pan and either use oil or butter to make the inside greasy. This will make sure that the brownie pieces come off clean when you bake them.

Step 8: Pour all of the brownie batter into the pan. Spread evenly.

Step 9: Put your pan in your oven. Set your oven to bake for 30 minutes.

Step 10: Take your brownies out and let them cool for 5-10 minutes. Enjoy!
